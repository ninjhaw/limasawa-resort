                <h3>History of Limasawa Island</h3>
                <p>Also known as Sarangani Island, “Mazaua” is actually the original name of this tadpole-shaped island lying at a latitude of 9 2/3 degrees towards the Arctic Pole (North) and 160 degrees longitude from the Demarcation Line, as inscribed in Antonio Pigaffeta’s “Primo Viaggio Intorno al Mondo,” which bears account of Ferdinand Magellan’s voyage around the world.
                    It is said that before the Spaniards landed on the island, the natives did not really have a name for the island. When asked, and because they did not understand Spanish, one of the natives mistakenly thought he was asked “How many wives does the Rajah have?” he immediately replied “lima’y asawa” or five wives. From then on, the island was called Limasawa.
                    The island of Limasawa used to be under the administrative jurisdiction of the Municipality of Malitbog.  When Padre Burgos was declared a separate municipality from Malitbog, Limasawa was made part of Padre Burgos.
                    On June 11, 1978, then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1549 creating Limasawa as an independent municipality in the province of Southern Leyte.   However, this was not implemented.
                    During his first term as Representative of Southern Leyte, Roger G. Mercado requested then President Corazon C. Aquino to hold a plebiscite to determine the islanders’ desire on the matter of independence from the mother municipality.  On March 17, 1989, Presidential Proclamation Bill No. 890 was signed by President Corazon C. Aquino which set the date for the plebiscite on May 21, 1989. The people of Limasawa overwhelmingly voted for the creation of a separate municipality.
                    Limasawa officially became a municipality on August 27, 1989.  Two days after, the newly-created municipality started operation at the house owned by the Palermo Family located in Barangay Triana.
